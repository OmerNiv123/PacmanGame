Functionality Added:
* Eating a **clock** will give the user 5 extra seconds.
* Eating a **heart** will give the user one more life.
* The clocks will **appear more frequently** when the user has little time left (as function of time).
* The hearts will **appear more frequently** when the user has less lives left (as function of lives).
* As the time goes, when the user has less time, **the pacman changes his color from yellow to orange and then red** before the time is up.
* The **ghosts can eat the clocks and hearts** and by that they can prevent pacman from eating them.
* We added **sound functionalities** for eating food, clocks, hearts and cherry.  Also winning or losing the game will give the user special sound.
* At the settings page, the user can **set the speed of the game** (speed of the pacman and the ghosts as one).
* Pressing the pacman logo in the menu will show welcome page.
* Pressing the ghost logo in the menu will show to the user the about modal.
* After Log in, "Log in" and "Register" buttons disappears and **"Log Out" and "Settings" appears.** The user can also logout and login as he wishes.
* The user **can pause** the game and continue when he will decide to.
* **The balls' colors** can be changed **dynamically** during game time.
